# Docker setup for php development (WIP)

Put this repository into your project root and copy `env.example` to `.env` and make changes as needed.

You should match `UID`,`GID`,`USERNAME` to your host machine.

See the commands in the `bin` directory.

```
└── project_root
    ├── docker
    └── public
        └── index.php
```

This is not meant to be used as a dependency. Clone it and change as needed!
